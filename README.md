# PersonaEventToFlow
A terrible Python script that generates flow and msg files that run every event it can find in Persona 5's files.

## How does it work?
It looks for **.PAK** files in Persona's events folder, copys the names of the **.PAK** files to a text file and then turns it into FlowScript. For .msg files it does the same thing again
only this time it turns it into Message Script.
